        <p align="left" class="bodytext">&quot;Michelle, Teegarden, 33, the registered 
          nurse from Kenosha, Wis. braved a two-hour commute and even got lost 
          a few times on the way to meeting the man of her dreams at the May [speeddating] 
          event held at the Chicago Historical Society. It turned out that Teegarden's 
          Mr. Right, Jerry Novitt, 36, co-owner of an Arlington Heights business, 
          also had a difficult commute downtown. He almost turned around to go 
          home. When he met Teegarden, thought, he was glad he suffered through 
          the bad traffic. A hair-raising commute turned out to be only one of 
          many things the two had in common.<br>
          &quot;From that first night we couldn't stop talking, &quot;he said. 
          Their seven-minute date turned into a four-hour stroll around the city 
          and a stop for Chinese food. &quot;It was very romantic. I didn't get 
          home until 3 a.m., &quot; recalled Teegarden.<br>
          By the time Beshert contacted Novitt and Teegarden abut their match, 
          they were way ahead of the game, already racking up miles on their cars 
          to see one another, and long-distance bills from daily phone conversations. 
          In June, Novitt proposed and they plan to get married next June. <br>
          Their six-week courtship, which seems to have happened with lightning 
          speed, might be viewed as an impulsive move by today's standards. However, 
          Novitt, a Beshert member since 1997, says he doesn't believe in following 
          hard-and-fast rules when it comes to matters of the heart. &quot;What 
          Michelle and I saw in each other is what we wanted in a soul mate. It 
          was that intense of a feeling, &quot; he said. &quot;In my 36 years, 
          I haven't clicked with someone so quickly.&quot;<br>

        in October 2001 and married in June 2002. Link* Social Events Dear Miss 
        Elsa,My name is Cheryl Miller and I went on your tour of Ethnic Chicago 
        with Irving Cutler on Sunday, October 7th 2001.I came on the tour with 
        an open mind thinking well, I have been new, lonely and single in suburban 
        Chicago for about 9 months, maybe I'll meet a nice guy for a date, even 
        a please female for a chat, or at the very least I'll learn something 
        about Chicago.Well, about halfway through the tour we stopped at a Czech 
        restaurant in Cicero for lunch. We each stood up and said a little something 
        about ourselves. I explained that I had come to Chicago 9 months previous 
        after 21 years in Israel and that I grew up in Baltimore. I soon learned 
        that there was someone else on the tour who was originally from Baltimore, 
        and had been in Chicago for 7 years. We then discovered that we were in 
        junior high school together and even in the same 6th grade elementary 
        school class.Intrigued by this, I made sure to get his number before he 
        got off the bus in the city. I remember because I then got off the bus 
        in the suburbs where your brother-in-law and family were nice enough to 
        drop me in Northbrook on their way home.One month later I called the &quot;Beshert 
        Baltimore Bloke&quot;. His name is John and he is today my husband!!!!! 
        We were in Israel in March for our engagement party and were married June 
        16th at B'nai Torah in Highland Park with all our friends and family from 
        Israel, Baltimore and Chicago.We are both the happiest people to have 
        met or shall we say rediscover one another. Thank you for having such 
        a great tour ideal. Just thought you should know! We are very happy.Sincerely,Cheryl 
        and John her &quot;Beshert Baltimore Bloke&quot;5. </p>
