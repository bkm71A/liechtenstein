Database beshert - maintenance.

Hello.

I tried to set up maintenance plan or do database backup and it looks like I 
don't have access rights.

How it usually works - do you do backups or you could grant me access rights ?
Also - what is the size of log file - could it be increased ?

Server : 209.133.228.101 Database - beshert


Thanks,
Slava KOvalenko

Hi,

Your database: beshert
username: beshert
pw: bkm71   has been setup.
To connect to your SQL database on our servers, here are the steps you need 
to do first configure your Client Network Utility:
1) open the Client Network Utility which comes with SQL 2000
2) Make sure that the default network library is set to TCP/IP on the general 
tab
3) add a server alias by clicking add
4) type in 209.133.228.101 then click ok and apply the changes

Next you need to add our SQL server in Enterprise Manager:
1) right click on SQL Server Group
2) Click New SQL Server Registration
3) choose to use the wizard your first time doing this and click next
4) in available servers, type in 209.133.228.101  and click add and next
5) Click the SQL server login from the connection options
6) Enter the username and password you were given/requested
7) Click add the SQL server to an existing server group and choose one
8) Click finish
Please note that many of these options can be changed to configure your 
server setup how you would like it.

Could you, please, setup MS SQL Server database for my site.

DB Name : beshert
DB Admin uid='bkm71'
Password ='bkm71'
I don't need DSN , ADO.NET will be used to access it from ASP.NET pages.

How could I access this db when installed ? Could I do it from my pc through MS SQL Enterprise Manager?


Please reply to bkm71@yahoo.com and elsa@beshert.com

> WHAT HAPPENS WITH DOMAIN TRANSFERS
>
> If we are moving your domain for you, we will send an e-mail to the
registering organisation who will then respond to us and the person who owns
the domain. After you accept the changes it should take between 24 and 48
hours to complete registration. If you are transfering the your domain by
yourself then our name servers are:
> Primary name server hostname: NS1.setupsite.com
> Primary name server IP: 209.133.228.10
> Secondary name server hostname: NS2.setupsite.com
> Seconday name server IP: 209.133.228.11
>
> HOW DO I TRANSFER MY DOMAIN NAME
>
> If you have chosen us to register your domain name for you then you do not
need to take any steps to change the name server information. If you are
registering your domain with another company then you will need to provide
them with the following name server information when you register the
domain. Primary name server: NS1.setupsite.com - 209.133.228.10, Secondary
name server: NS2.setupsite.com - 209.133.228.11

>
> Most customers will be able to use the control panel with all their
domains. However a couple of servers do not have the control panel software
installed yet and you may find one or more of your domains are inaccessible
from the control panel when you log in. We plan to have the control panel
installed on all of our servers in a week or two time.
>
> WHEN CAN I USE THE CONTROL PANEL?
> It takes at least 24 hours once you receive this e-mail before you can
actually logon to the control panel. Any changes you make to your account
such as adding Extra Domains also take about 24 hours to appear in the
control panel. At present you can only log on  to the control panel once
your name server information has be transfered to Setup Site. We are looking
into a way to make it possible to log on to the control panel before name
server information has changed.
